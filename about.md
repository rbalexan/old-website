# About Me
I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University. In May 2019, I'll graduate with my degree (whoop!) and in September 2019, I'll start pursuing my Master of Science in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University. Earlier in 2019, I was selected as a [Stanford Graduate Fellow in Science & Engineering](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details)!

My future graduate research is focused on estimation and control of stochastic systems, nonlinear dynamics, machine learning, decision-making systems, uncertainty quantification (UQ), optimization, and model-order reduction.
