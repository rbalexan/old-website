# About R. B. Alexander
I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University. In May 2019, I'll graduate with my degree (whoop!) and in September 2019, I'll start pursuing my Master of Science in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University. Earlier in 2019, I was selected as a [Stanford Graduate Fellow in Science & Engineering](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details)!

My current focus is on macOS app development with Swift and Node.js-based packages and CLI tools. I actively maintain [1000+ npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~sindresorhus) and [many popular projects](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+user%3Achalk+user%3Aavajs+user%3Axojs&type=Repositories).
